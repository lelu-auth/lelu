# Lelu

## About the Project

Lelu is a framework-agnostic authorization engine for AI agents. It combines policy evaluation, confidence-aware controls, runtime risk checks, and human-review workflows in one system.

It is designed so teams can ship agent features faster without weakening security.

Out of the box, Lelu provides:

- Confidence-aware authorization
- Prompt-injection prefiltering
- Human-in-the-loop review queue
- Runtime risk evaluation
- Short-lived (JIT) scoped tokens
- Audit trail and incident hooks
- SQLite local storage (works offline)
- PostgreSQL for production deployments

## Why Lelu

Authorization for AI agents is still a half-solved problem. Most tools handle static rules but do not account for model uncertainty, dynamic risk, and operational safety in one flow.

Lelu solves this by making decisions through a layered pipeline:

- Injection check
- Confidence resolution and gate
- Policy evaluation (YAML or Rego)
- Risk evaluation
- Most-restrictive final decision merge

This helps teams avoid over-permissive agent behavior while keeping developer workflow simple.
